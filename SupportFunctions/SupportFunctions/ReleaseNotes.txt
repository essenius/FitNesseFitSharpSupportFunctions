2.0.1 Added documentation for several APIs

2.1.0 Replaced FixtureExplorer dictionary by [Documentation] attributes
2.2.0 Introduced Errors field for CsvComparison script fixture, returning a hash table of errors (null if none).
      Introduced Cell column in CsvComparison query and table tables, returning cell reference in Excel format.
      Added Concatenate in CommonFunctions to replace Concat, and deprecated Concat. 
	  Refactored some methods with high complexity and class coupling 
2.3.0 Introduced RegexEscape and RegexUnescape. Removed some debugging info and eliminated unnecessary code. 
      Extracted RowColumnComparer into its own file. 
2.3.1 Introduced XML documentation to replace [Documentation] attributes
2.3.2 Fixed Image comparison error caused by an extra space before the end of image tags
2.3.3 Made DoOn case insensitive for members, added object as a valid type for EvaluateAs
2.3.4 Introduced Get and GetOf to replace DoOn, as more natural to use (DoOn was still experimental) and placed them in fixture ReflectionFunctions.
      Allowed system types like int, bool, long in Get functions; improved method usage to allow both params and 'of' input.
      TypeDictionary now gets the standard types from inspecting mscorlib instead of hardcoding.
      Introduced Requires to replace Debug.Assert
