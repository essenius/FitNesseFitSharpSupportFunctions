The Stop Test If command throws a !-StopTestException-! if the parameter evaluates to true, or if it can't be parsed as a boolean
Stop Test If Not throws the exception if the parameter evaluates to false, or if it can't be parsed as a boolean

This table should not stop the test

!|script                    |
|$ok=            |echo|true |
|stop test if not|$ok       |
|$error=         |echo|false|
|stop test if    |$error    |

The next test should stop the test. 
The Evaluate command throws an exception, so $calcResult is not defined. This means that FitNesse simply passed '$calcResult' to the fixture, which it can't parse as a boolean.

|script                                                     |
|$calcResult=|evaluate|irrelevant    |as    |unknownType    |
|stop test if|$calcResult                                   |
|$notset=    |echo    |this statement should not be executed|
