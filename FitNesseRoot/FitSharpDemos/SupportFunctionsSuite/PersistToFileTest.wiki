Create a new dictionary (different instance), and load the file we just saved. 
Delete it then, so we don't leave a mess. Then check if the data loaded correctly

!|script  |dictionary library               |
|check    |count    |0                      |
|load file|${FileName}                      |
|delete file                                |
|check    |count    |4                      |
|check    |get      |name|=~/b.b/           |
|ensure   |get      |employed               |
|check    |read Stopwatch|1|<1|

Check if we can load the dictionary into a variable and use that

!|script                                                   |
|$dict=|get dictionary                                     |
|check |get                         |phone|from|$dict|12345|
|check |echo                        |$dict|$dict           |
|check |stop Stopwatch|1    |<1              |
