These last two are tricky ones. The parser takes numbers with a decimal point as decimals
So the first evaluates in decimal, and threfore keeps its decimal precision.
Numbers without decimal points are tried as ints, longs and if that doesn't work doubles.
So the second example is evaluated as double, so it loses precision before its cast back to decimal.
