Now some characters that must be encoded such as <>&

We use this page to grab a table from, just as demo. 


!|script   |dictionary library                            |
|page root |http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/${PAGE_PATH}|
|load table|main       |from page      |${PAGE_NAME}      |
|check     |count      |5                                 |
|check     |get        |name           |=~/b.b/           |
|check     |get        |address        |there             |

Here is where the test ends. Below this are only test data tables

Note that this test will fail the next time it is run, because the page has changed
This also shows why it is kind of tricky to use this functionality

Introduce an empty scenario so the tables don't break the test run

|scenario|Dictionary _ _ _|Name, Key, Value|

This is the table to be captured. 

!|Dictionary|Having|Name|Main|
|Key|Value|
|name|bob|
|address|there|
|phone|2345|
|employed|true|
|date|2016-08-13 17:04:43|

The following table should be ignored
|Dictionary|having|Name|Wrong|
|Key       |Value            |
|name      |joop             |
|address   |here             |
|phone     |23456            |
|employed  |false            |
